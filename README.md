upon opening the application you will be met with a menu and 6 options, the first allowing you to create a new recipe adding the amount of ingredients as well as their quantities and measurent types. You will also add steps which will allow anyone to follow and recreate the recipe exactly. The next option in the menu is to view recipe, this allows you to see the currently saved recipe and is displayed in a manner which makes it easy to read. The third option in the menu is too scale the recipe by either half, double or triple which allows larger or smaller batches of whatever you wish to cook or bake. the fourth option is to rescale the recipe from its previously scaled form. the fifth option allows you to erase the saved recipe and reset  all the arrays to allow for a new recipe to be added. and finally the sixth option allows you to exit the program, note that any saved recipe will be forgotten by the program upon it shutting down. happy cooking!
